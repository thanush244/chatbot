# React Chatbot with Gemini AI

This project is a chatbot application built with React and FastAPI, using Gemini AI for generating responses.

## Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Frontend Firebase configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
```

2. For the backend, set the following environment variable:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

## Running the Application

### Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn google-generativeai firebase-admin
python -m uvicorn backend:app --reload --port 8000
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:8000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
